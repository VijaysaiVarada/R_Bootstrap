# R_Bootstrap

Performed simple lm model with classic, balanced bootstrapping and with out bootstaping
Generataed confidence Intervels for each estimates 
to compare the precision of the estimates among all the three models. 

From the output we can see that balanced boothstrap has shorter interval than classis implying a better precision.
